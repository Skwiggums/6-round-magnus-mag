5 6-32 x 0.5" SHCS screws for mag bodies, one 6-32 x 1.5" for mag follower
one constant force drum spring from Foamblast or OoD
A random short screw to secure magazine sides together at top.

Save the two screws from your magnus that hold the right side mag plate to the right side body, these will go into the screw shims.

Assembly steps

1. Cut out the bottom of the mag and all ribs that up the magazine on both body sides (see cuts picture). 
    Leave the screw bosses which secured the mag plate on the right side body in place.
2. Assemble the follower and drum spring and attach the drum spring to the right side mag body.
3. Place the bracer then right mag side over the screw bosses. Insert screw shims and screws to secure the right mag side to the magnus.
4. Assemble the rest of the mag per Toruk's instruction.
5. Place lone screw in the hole near the top of the mag to secure the magazine together. Reassemble your magnus and enjoy your hand cannon.
